# Seckill

### A solution of high concurrency in online-shopping web application

In China, large online-shopping websites (e.g. www.taobao.com, www.jd.com) hold events of sales promotion every year during which many products are sold at very low prices. This kind of event is called **Seckill** (Second kill, 秒杀).

Seckill events are featured with high concurrency of user requests in a very short period of time, because such events always start at a given time, and amounts of users of such websites in China are enormous while stocks of products are pretty limited. Obviously, solutions that deal with such extremely high concurrency are required.

### How this project tries to address the issue

First of all, this project simulates a seckill event by building a full-stack web application selling mobile phones at low prices.

The back end of this application is built upon **SpringBoot**, using **Mybatis** for **MySQL** database management. It also enables distributed session on multiple servers by storing user token in cookies and a **Redis** database, which is much more efficient than MySQL.

The front end of this application is simply based on **Bootstrap** and **Thymeleaf**, in order to focus on the business logic.

To ensure correctness of business logic, I used the **RabbitMQ** message queue. It works in the way that users' requests of purchases are forwarded to a message queue first, then processed one by one. Therefore, the stock of goods will not be decreased to a negative number due to concurrent accesses, meanwhile the emergence of redundant orders becomes impossible.

To optimize the performance under high concurrency, I cached the goods-list page and the frequently accessed goods info (e.g. stock counts) in Redis database, and made the goods-detail and order-detail pages static so that they can be cached at browser end. This approach also allows the stock of goods to be decreased beforehand in Redis, thus reducing the load of MySQL database.

Moreover, to deal with possible malicious accesses, I used the following approaches: hiding the real URL of seckill page; limiting each user's number of accesses within a certain period of time. To make it safer, **captcha** will also be shown when a user clicks the "buy" button, which is intended for verifying the legal access of seckill API.

I used **JMeter** to do load test on this application and measure its performance (based on **QPS**, queries per second). The comparison of results (before and after optimization) are shown below:

Seckill API (accessed when user clicks "buy", presumably most frequently accessed):

|Concurrency |1000 * 10        |5000 * 10          |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------  |
|QPS (before)|1669 / sec       |1426 / sec         |
|QPS (after) |3659 ~ 4529 / sec|2685 ~ 3450 / sec  |

Goods list page:

|Concurrency |1000 * 10        |5000 * 10          |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------  |
|QPS (before)|2140 / sec       |1323 / sec         |
|QPS (after) |3368 ~ 4210 / sec|2970 ~ 4334 / sec  |
